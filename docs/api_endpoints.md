## Common errors

This list contains common errors and their responses.

### Malformed JSON

Happens whenever a request contains incorrect JSON syntax.

The response will be:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: close

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Malformed JSON body"
}
```

### Authentication errors

Whenever an authenticated route is requested, a middleware parses the request for an `accessToken`.

If the request gets authenticated, it will simply get passed on to the next handler.

Should the `Authorization: Bearer {jsonWebToken}` header be missing or malformed, these responses will be sent:

Header missing:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Missing Authorization header"
}
```

Malformed header or invalid access token:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Invalid authorization token"
}
```

Expired access token:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "jwt expired"
}
```

## POST /signup

### Description

Â Of these fields, only `middleName` is optional.

An example of a correct `HTTP POST` request to this endpoint can be found at [this link](../examples/request/post/signup.http).

### Responses

X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: close

{

```

Depending on which field is missing from the request, the following response is returned:

```http

X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

    "Email is not valid",
    "Birthday should be a valid ISO date"
  ]
}
```

If a user with the corresponding `email` is found in the database, the response will be:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: close

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "User with email example@example.com already exists"
}
```

## GET /routes

### Description

Returns all possible routes in a JSON format.

### Headers

No headers are required.

### Fields

No fields are required.

### Responses

An example response will be:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: close

{
  "error": false,
  "routes": {
    "get": [
      "/getRoute1"
    ],
    "post": [
      "/postRoute1",
      "/postRoute2"
    ],
    "put": [
      "/putRoute1"
    ],
    "patch": [
      "/patchRoute1",
      "/patchRoute2"
    ],
    "delete": [
      "/deleteRoute1"
    ],
  }
}
```

## POST /login

### Description

Log in to an existing user.

### Headers

`Content-Type: application/json`

### Fields

- `email`: a string representing the user email. Any email **will** be converted to lowercase. Example: `email@example.com`.

- `password`: plain text password string. Will be hashed and salted using `argon2` before being compared to the saved hashes. Example: `VerySecurePassword`.

### Responses

If it succeeds, the request will return the following response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": false,
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySGVhZGVySUQiOjIsImlhdCI6MTYzNjA2MjEwMiwiZXhwIjoxNjM2MDYzMDAyfQ.IyoeAywnHqGBN6XWECtXFiUFRfLIgl-sr2XjmXRTtr8",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySGVhZGVySUQiOjIsImlhdCI6MTYzNjA2MjEwMn0.2g_tvIrY89KWw_bnPme0Pc68wsE0gN-wUgxznqhYgX8"
}
```

The `accessToken` value needs to be used everywhere authentication is needed, as a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/). By default, these tokens will expire after 15 minutes.

`refreshToken`s, instead, do not expire, and will be invalidated once used for the first time; their purpose is to get a new pair of tokens whenever the `accessToken` expires.

Should any of the two fields be missing, the following response will be returned:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": [
    "Email should not be blank",
    "Password should not be blank"
  ]
}
```

If the email is not valid, this response will be returned:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": [
    "Email is not valid"
  ]
}
```

When a wrong email is provided:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "No user credentials found for email example@example.it"
}
```

When a wrong password is provided:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Wrong password"
}
```

## POST /logout

### Description

Deletes a user's refresh token, practically invalidating the access token at the expiry date.

It's an **authenticated** endpoint. This means you need to first obtain an `accessToken` by [logging in](#post-login).

### Headers

`Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}`

`Content-Type: application/json`

### Fields

- `refreshToken`: the refresh token to be invalidated.

### Responses

If it succeeds, the request will return the following response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": false,
  "message": "User logged out successfully"
}
```

If the `refreshToken` is omitted:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "No refresh token provided"
}
```

If the `refreshToken` is provided, but does not belong to any user:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Refresh token doesn't belong to any session"
}
```

Should - by any chance - the payloads be missing in any of the two tokens:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Invalid access or refresh token(s)"
}
```

If refresh and access token refer to different users in their payload:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Tokens refer to different users"
}
```

## GET /user/{id}/settings

### Description

List user's settings.

It's an **authenticated** endpoint. This means you need to first obtain an `accessToken` by [logging in](#post-login).

### Headers

`Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}`

### Fields

- `accessToken`: JWT string obtained via the login process.

### Responses

Unless an [authentication error](#authentication-errors) occurs, the response will be:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": false,
  "settings": {
    "abbreviatedFormat": 1,
    "currency": 50,
    "darkMode": 0
  }
}
```
